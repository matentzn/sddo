    <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Procedure">
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world (via an Actuator). A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible results.</rdfs:comment>

A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many Observations, Samplings, or Actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible results.</skos:definition>
        <skos:example xml:lang="en">The measured wind speed differs depending on the height of the sensor above the surface, e.g., due to friction. Consequently, procedures for measuring wind speed define a standard height for anemometers above ground, typically 10m for meteorological measures and 2m in Agrometeorology. This definition of height, sensor placement, and so forth are defined by the Procedure.</skos:example>
        <skos:note xml:lang="en">Many observations may be created via the same Procedure, the same way as many tables are assembled using the same instructions (as information objects, not their concrete realization).</skos:note>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Feature which is intended to be representative of a FeatureOfInterest on which Observations may be made.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Physical samples are sometimes known as &apos;specimens&apos;.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Samples are artifacts of an observational strategy, and have no significant function outside of their role in the observation process. The characteristics of the samples themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.

A Sample is intended to sample some FatureOfInterest, so there is an expectation of at least one isSampleOf property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/"/>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Feature which is intended to be representative of a FeatureOfInterest on which Observations may be made.</skos:definition>
        <skos:example xml:lang="en">A &apos;station&apos; is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or Procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the &apos;world in the vicinity of the station&apos;, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artifact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.</skos:example>
        <skos:example xml:lang="en">A statistical sample is often designed to be characteristic of an entire population, so that observations can be made regarding the sample that provide a good estimate of the properties of the population.</skos:example>
        <skos:note xml:lang="en">A transient sample, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.</skos:note>

        <skos:example xml:lang="en">A ball mill, diamond drill, hammer, hypodermic syringe and needle, image Sensor or a soil auger can all act as sampling devices (i.e., be Samplers). However, sometimes the distinction between the Sampler and the Sensor is not evident, as they are packaged as a unit. A Sampler need not be a physical device.</skos:example>
